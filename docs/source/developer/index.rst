You are interested by GAMCR and you want to use our code for your own research projects? This is the place to be ! 

In that case, you may require to modify the code to fit your specific expectations. In this section, we provide additional information on our implementation that should allow you to easily modify the code for your needs (and in particular to add new functionalities).



Changing the set of possible features used by the GAMs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the `Dataset` class of the GAMCR package, you can modify the code to use different features that the one we have considered in our paper. For this, you should adapt the method `get_design`. You should give a specific name to your feature and perform the computations needed. Then, we can adapt the set of features you use in the GAMs by changing the attribute *features* when you create a new instance of GAMCR.
